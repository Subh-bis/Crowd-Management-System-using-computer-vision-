The Crowd Management System with Voice Assistant Alert and Computer
 Vision offers a novel approach to enhancing crowd control and safety in
 dynamic, high-density environments. By leveraging advanced computer vision
 techniques, the system is capable of real-time monitoring and analysis of crowd
 behaviors, including density, movement patterns, and potential risks. The
 integration of a voice assistant allows for hands-free interaction, facilitating
 quicker decision-making and reducing response time in critical situations.
 Through automated alerts and actionable insights, security personnel and event
 organizers can manage crowds more effectively, preventing overcrowding,
 identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring public safety.
